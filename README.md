[EZRxLookup](http://54.152.36.169:8080/EZRxLookup/) (http://54.152.36.169:8080/EZRxLookup) promotes a consumer focused view of FDA Approved Drug Label, Drug Recall, and Adverse Drug Event data, providing users with an easy-to-use, informative, and reliable tool that quickly enables informed decision-making regarding prescription and over-the-counter drugs. The EZRxLookup prototype was launched by Bart and Associates, Inc. (B&A), GS-35F-5924H, on July 7, 2015. 

[B&A](http://www.bna-inc.com) provides strategic, enterprise, application, and technical infrastructure solutions. Managed to Software Engineering Institute (SEI) Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI)® Level 3, IT Infrastructure Library (ITIL®), Lean and Agile best practices, B&A builds both customized and Commercial-Off-The-Shelf (COTS) applications for the Federal Government. B&A specializes in all aspects of [Agile Software Delivery](http://www.bna-inc.com/services.agile.html), including product design, Agile development, and operations. Our approach to product design leverages best practices from Lean User Experience (UX) with an understanding that the best designed products and services result from understanding the needs of the people who will use them. Our goal is to turn ideas into code as quickly as possible. This is realized through our application of Agile development capabilities. We are committed to incorporating the processes and practices necessary to demonstrate working software with the shortest lead-time. [Continuous integration and automated deployment](Documentation/DevOps/Continuous%20Integration%20Jobs) (consistent with our [configuration and change management processes](Documentation/DevOps/EZRxLookup%20Change%20Log.pdf)) are implemented to ensure code written by the team is integrated, tested, used to build the application, run [unit and acceptance tests](src/test), automatically deploy the application to the applicable environment, and run system acceptance tests. To establish an effective [deployment pipeline and process](Documentation/DevOps/EZRxLookup%20Deployment%20Pipeline.pdf), our operations team is fully engaged throughout the development process, facilitating delivery flow and providing the full range of operations support functions, including [continuous monitoring](Documentation/DevOps/AWS%20Continuous%20Monitoring.pdf), administration, and incident and problem management. B&A successfully demonstrated aspects of our Agile software delivery capabilities with our award-winning participation at GSA’s Digital Innovation and Strategy Hack-a-thon, held on May 8, 2015 (http://fcw.com/articles/2015/05/08/hackathon-winners.aspx).

Our [approach](Documentation/AgileDev/Approach%20to%20GSA%20Challenge.pdf) (depicted below) to creating EZRxLookup was built on core values of Code Quality, Transparency, Program Execution, Alignment, and Continuous Improvement, following the [U.S. Digital Services Playbook](Documentation/AgileDev/Evidence%20EZRxLookup%20Follows%20the%20U.S.%20Digital%20Services%20Playbook.pdf), and applying our Agile software delivery capabilities to iteratively and incrementally deliver EZRxLookup features to our users.

Our team consisted of five multi-specialized, collaborative resources, headed by a Product Manager, with full authority, responsibility, and accountability for the successful delivery of the EZRxLookup prototype (see Appendix C for specifics on the labor categories and resources assembled) and two people we identified as users of the prototype. We held discovery sessions to gain a better understanding of the openFDA data sets and our user’s problems regarding access to the openFDA data. As a result, we identified our unique value proposition and a [minimum viable product](Documentation/ProductDesign/EZRxLookup%20System%20Flow%20Document.pdf), derived from our possible solutions to problems that had not yet been solved in the current public domain. Product design sessions flushed out the products intended uses, goals, points of interaction, and potential pain points leading to the development of the initial product features. Using human-centered design tools and techniques, including [personas, journey maps, system flows, wireframes, and mockups](Documentation/ProductDesign), following [Mozilla](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/styleguide) and Franklin Covery style guides, we refined and continuously validated priority product features, decomposing them into user stories with acceptance criteria within our [product backlog](Documentation/AgileDev/EZRxLookup%20Product%20Roadmap.pdf). We conducted five product iterations, each consisting of planning, breakout/user story execution, [stakeholder demos/usability tests](Documentation/ProductDesign/EZRxLookup%20Usability%20Test%20Report.pdf), retrospectives, and daily standups to [develop our EZRxLookup prototype](Documentation/AgileDev/Execution%20Highlights%20of%20EZRxLookup%20GSA%20Approach.pdf), using [user feedback](Documentation/ProductDesign/User%20Feedback%20Forms) as a means to inform subsequent iterations/versions. 

The prototype consumes multiple [APIs](/src/main/resources/openFdaConfig.properties) exposed by openFDA and takes advantage of [modern technologies](Documentation/AgileDev/EZRxLookup%20Tools%20and%20Technologies%20Used.pdf), including Java, Spring/SpringMVC, PrimeFaces, Elasticsearch, JSON, and Gradle (which are all openly [licensed](LICENSE) and free of charge), deployed on an [Amazon Web Services (AWS) Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS) Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](Documentation/DevOps/EZRxLookup%20IaaS%20Deployment%20-%20AWS.pdf) instance. Our internal implementation of Elasticsearch supports consumption, remixing, and indexing of openFDA data related to approved drug labels, providing a simple suggestions interface to promote ease and accuracy of search criteria entry. Supporting a responsive design, via a [cross platform, multi-device environment](Documentation/ProductDesign/Multiple%20Device%20Support), the prototype enables and provides access to EZRxLookup while at home or on-the-go. Prior to the launch of EZRxLookup, we conducted a final user acceptance test and gained consolidated acceptance of the product. In response to GSA questions and answers received, our DevOps resources updated EZRxLookup to build a [Docker image, uploaded it to DockerHub](Documentation/DevOps/EZRxLookup%20Container%20Deployment.pdf), and received final signoff of the product from the Product Manager in preparation for launch. Anyone can [install and run the EZRxLookup Docker image](Documentation/DevOps/EZRxLookup%20Installation%20and%20Run%20Guide.pdf) in an AWS EC2 Container using the EC2 Container Management Services (ECS) or any other compatible Docker Container. 

EZRxLookup provides its users with the ability to search for a drug quickly using auto complete suggestions and to view at-a-glance, whether a drug is safe based on recall status or reported adverse events due to our simplified visualization. New EZRxLookup searches are just a click away, via selection of the EZRxLookup logo, which is available on all screens. We extended agility to our product, streamlining complex, comprehensive data and transformed it into easily searchable, readable, and understandable data that empowers users to make the right decisions for themselves and their families.
